                <p>recently, for a class project, i redesigned the moodfit mental health app. it was a quarter-long 
                    project that gave me a hands-on approach to learning the design process from background research, competitor
                    benchmarking, and user reasearch to wireframing, critiquing, and iterative design to reach a "final" product.

                <h2>!classfinder (in progress)</h2>
                <p> classfinder, not to be confused with !classfinder, is the current solution 
                    WWU students use to build their schedules. it was a senior project in 1989, and 
                    the time came for it to be remade as a senior project again. the name !classfinder came from our client's wish for our solution to 
                    be something completely different from classfinder; at the same time we wanted to be able to use the name recognition of the software 
                    that students are already familiar with - thus,
                    !classfinder (for those who don't code often or at all, "!" is the symbol for "not"). i've been leading the front end 
                    team for my whole senior year - including creating user stories, user journeys, and multiple prototypes
                    that i sent out and got feedback on in order to assess student needs and design iteratively before actually hitting the keyboard
                    . we are actively implementing the front end, but go here for the <a href="./classfinder.html" class="pageLink">user journeys & creative process so far! </a>

                <h2>association for gender inclusion in computing logo</h2>
                <p>i've been an officer in the AGIC since the second week of my freshman year; when i joined, the club was named
                    the AWC (association for women in computing). starting sophomore year, i ran the club for two years before 
                    i realized that i was running a club for women, but i was not a "woman", nor were all of our members. 
                    i started using she/they pronouns, and my co-president was using they/she pronouns; we realized that we 
                    needed to change the club name to better represent the people our club was for. we got together with our officers,
                    and came up with the new name, and with the new name we fully rebranded. i designed a new logo, created 
                    meaningful documentation for club expectations, officer roles, and a code of conduct we could all get behind. 
                    check out the iterations of the logo and what it means here: <a href="./agic.html" class="pageLink">agic logo design</a>

                    as the only active diversity related club in the computer science department, the agic is often

                    putting together a well-researched presentation to educate on the lack of diversity in computer science,
                    from age 4 all the way to industry and retirement. <a href="./diversity.html" class="pageLink" id="researchLink">view the presentation here</a>
