                    during my years at wwu, my favorite classes have always been the classes i've taken 
                    for my ux minor. my sophomore year, i took the hardest class i've taken to date: 
                    the foundations of visual communications. it was a three hour long class twice a week,
                    and i had to fill eight 8.5" by 11" pages per week. it made my 400 level 
                    systems classes look easy. before this class, i thought i was terrible at drawing. 
                    but that quarter i learned that the biggest obstacle wasn't my skill, but my own perfectionism. 
                    foundations of visual comm taught me how to be bad at things on the first try, 
                    how to be confident and decisive in my motions- to draw without using a pencil before a pen, and though my own
                    exporations in recreating the objects and space around me, i learned an entirely 
                    different way to see the world - the parts and how they create their sums.

                <p>after taking an introductory web development class in my freshman year, i found a love
                    for designing and creating websites. i discovered that it fed my creative and analytical
                    sides equally, which puts me in my flow state (please, ask me about flow psychology). i 
                    have two websites that are published
                    aside from my own; the first is <a href="https://myfiverules.com/" target="blank" class="pageLink">myfiverules.com</a> , 
                    which was a job i took customizing a squarespace site. the second site i built from the ground up
                    for one of my favorite creative friends - <a href="https://kentakesphotos.com/" target="blank"  class="pageLink">kentakesphotos.com</a> .

                <p>
                    in my senior year of high school, i took a film photography class to fill my art credits.
                    at first, i didn't get the appeal, because i started the class taking pictures of "things"
                    (our first assignment was "person, place, thing"). as soon as i developed my roll for "person",
                    i realized that black and white film can show you what a person really looks like.
                    it shows all of the things you can see when you're around someone in real life - 
                    their energy, how they feel, how they make others feel, how they present 
                    themselves in the world. the question i love the most always comes after a smile when 
                    i show someone their film portraits: "is that what i really look like?"
